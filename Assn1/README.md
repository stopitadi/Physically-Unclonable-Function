# COCO-PUF Project

## Overview

This project explores the creation and security evaluation of a novel Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) variant named the Cross-Connection PUF (COCO-PUF). The primary objective is to address the vulnerability of traditional arbiter PUFs, which can be compromised using linear regression models.

## Arbiter PUF

Arbiter PUFs operate by sending a signal through a series of multiplexers, where an arbiter at the end determines whether the upper or lower signal reaches the finish line first, generating a response. Despite their unique and unpredictable nature, arbiter PUFs are susceptible to attacks using linear regression models.

**Problems with Arbiter PUF:**
- Vulnerable to attacks via linear regression models due to their predictable nature.

## COCO-PUF

To enhance security, the COCO-PUF utilizes two arbiter PUFs with distinct sets of multiplexers. Given a challenge, both PUFs receive the same input, and responses are generated by comparing signals across the two PUFs:
- **Response0**: Generated by comparing the lower signals from PUF0 and PUF1 using Arbiter0.
- **Response1**: Generated by comparing the upper signals from PUF0 and PUF1 using Arbiter1.

This cross-connection approach ensures that each challenge produces two distinct responses, adding an extra layer of complexity and security to the PUF.

## Latest PUF Technologies

Recent PUF technologies have developed unique, tamper-resistant digital fingerprints for electronic devices. These fingerprints are generated from the inherent and unpredictable variations in the manufacturing process of semiconductor devices, making each PUF unique and nearly impossible to replicate or clone. Innovations in PUF technology include solutions like Intrinsic ID's Zign® and QuiddiKey® series, which offer robust encryption and hardware root of trust for IoT devices, enhancing their security against cyber threats.
